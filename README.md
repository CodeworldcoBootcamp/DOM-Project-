# DOM Project - Codeworldco 

In this REPO we are going to be accessing the GitHub API and building a user card based on the data we get back. 
The CSS and the base HTML is already done for you, you simply need to create the component function and connect the pieces!

### Part 1: Requesting Data from the GitHub API

* Instructions can found in the GitHubCard/index.js file to request data from the GitHub API.

### Part 2: Create the component function

* Once you are receiving data from the GitHub API, take some time to study the data and the information it is giving you. You will create the HTML template you see in the GitHubCard/index.js file and plugging in the dynamic data you are getting from the GitHub API.
* Once you complete the component, create a component based on your profile and add it to the DOM.

### Part 3: Your Friends

* After you have successfully added your own card to the DOM, we will get a list of your followers and programmatically add cards for them as well. Follow the instructions in GitHubCard/index.js.
